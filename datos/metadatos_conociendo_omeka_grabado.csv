For this series—produced for his most faithful patron Thomas Butts, a government clerk—Blake drew on chapters 12 and 13 of the Book of Revelations, an apocalyptic text akin to the artist's own prophetic writings.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this narrative the Dragon, identified with Satan, schemes to seize the soon-to-be born Redeemer from his mother. Derived from the Virgin Mary of the Gospels, the figure known as the Woman Clothed with the Sun also stands for Israel and for the Church. Blake's threatening Dragon displays powerful musculature as well as its monstrous tail, wings, and horned heads. Subsequent scenes reveal the failure of the Dragon's plan but the emergence of new threats to mankind.<br /><p>Object metadata can change over time, please check the Brooklyn Museum <a href=""http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4368/The_Great_Red_Dragon_and_the_Woman_Clothed_with_the_Sun_Rev._12%3A_1-4"" rel=""nofollow"">object record</a> for the latest information.</p>",Image: 17 3/16 x 13 11/16 in.

After much hesitation, Baraham allows the disguised king to spend the night in his courtyard, on the condition that he pay for any damage he may inflict and that he clean up after his horse. Bahram and his horse spend the night outdoors while his host enjoys a sumptuous feast inside.
